## Core Components of Mercurio AI

Mercurio AI is built with a modular architecture, consisting of several key components:

1. **Market Data Service**: Provides access to historical and real-time market data
   - Supports multiple data providers
   - Includes fallback mechanisms to sample data when needed
   - Handles data preprocessing for analysis

2. **Trading Service**: Executes trades based on strategy signals
   - Supports paper trading for practice
   - Connects to real trading accounts when ready
   - Manages order execution and tracking

3. **Backtesting Service**: Tests strategies against historical data
   - Simulates trades based on historical prices
   - Calculates performance metrics
   - Visualizes results for analysis

4. **Strategy Manager**: Manages different trading strategies
   - Includes pre-built strategies (Moving Average, LSTM, etc.)
   - Allows for custom strategy development
   - Handles strategy optimization

## Available Trading Strategies

Mercurio AI comes with several pre-built strategies:

1. **Moving Average Strategy**: A classic technical analysis approach based on price crosses of different moving average periods
   - Simple to understand and implement
   - Effective in trending markets
   - Available with or without machine learning enhancements

2. **LSTM Predictor Strategy**: Uses Long Short-Term Memory neural networks to predict price movements
   - Capable of learning complex patterns
   - Adapts to changing market conditions
   - Requires more data and computational resources

3. **Transformer Strategy**: Leverages transformer neural networks (similar to those used in language models)
   - Excellent at capturing long-range dependencies in price data
   - State-of-the-art performance on certain assets
   - More complex to train and optimize

4. **LLM Strategy**: Utilizes large language models for market analysis and prediction
   - Incorporates natural language understanding of market news
   - Can process multiple data types (text, numbers, etc.)
   - Cutting-edge approach to market prediction

## Getting the Most from This Guide

Throughout this guide, we'll be exploring every aspect of Mercurio AI in a hands-on, practical way. Here's how to get the most from your learning experience:

- **Follow Along with Code**: Try running the examples on your own machine
- **Experiment**: Don't just copy the examples—modify them to see what happens
- **Start Small**: Begin with simple strategies before moving to complex ones
- **Use Paper Trading**: Always test in a simulated environment first
- **Be Patient**: Algorithmic trading is a skill that takes time to develop
